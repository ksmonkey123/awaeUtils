 * implementation. Before the first step a start handler is called.According to
 * indication of the step implementation the base loop can be terminated. If the
 * step yields an interrupt, the loop is terminated as well. After loop
 * termination a termination handling method is called, after an interrupt
 * handler has been run in case of an interrupt being the reason for the loop
 * termination.
