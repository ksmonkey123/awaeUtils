/**
 * Builder for constructing state machine cores. Multiple of these builders can
 * be combined in a {@link StateMachineBuilder} to construct a state machine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A machine core describes a single state machine with exactly one active state
 * at any time. Multiple cores can be combined into a {@link StateMachine} at
 * which point they are combined into a state machine cluster with common event
 * and command queues. The builder does perform some preliminary data validation
 * on every mutation. A full data validation is performed by the
 * {@link StateMachineBuilder} whenever a core is added.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Machine Core construction</h3>
 * <p>
 * A machine core is constructed by defining a list of transitions. From these
 * transitions the states are extracted automatically. Transitions can be added
 * by calling
 * {@link #addTransition(String, String, String, String[], String[])}. Every
 * machine core requires an initial state to be defined. That is the state the
 * machine core starts in and is reverted to whenever a state machine is reset
 * using {@link StateMachine#reset()}. This initial state can be set through
 * {@link #setInitialState(String)}.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Helper Methods</h4>
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #addSequence(String, String[], String, String[], String[])}
 * allows for easy definition of a <em>transition sequence</em>, i.e. an ordered
 * list of events that - if occurring in that sequence - result in a given
 * transition. The intermediate states are generated internally and are expected
 * to be unique (the state names are derived from random {@link UUID}'s).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The method
 * {@link #addArbitrarySequence(String, String[], String, String[], String[])}
 * allows for easy definition of a set of transitions for a given unordered list
 * of events. The resulting transitions represent a system where all events in
 * the given list must occur in any order to result in a given transition. The
 * resulting system grows very quickly with the number of events in the list. It
 * is recommended to avoid exceeding 4-5 entries as otherwise many thousands of
 * states may be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #addFunnel(String[], String, String, String[], String[])}
 * allows for easy definition of the same transition from multiple origins to a
 * single target state. This is very useful if there are multiple states that
 * should respond to a given event identically. If combined with the
 * {@link #addSequence(String, String[], String, String[], String[])} method
 * this can for example be used to create "reset" transitions for each
 * intermediate state in the sequence.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Terminal State Checking</h3>
 * <p>
 * By default during creation each core validates that there are no terminal
 * states (i.e. states that have no transitions leaving them). Often terminal
 * states are not desired as most state machines should be able (by some
 * sequence of events) to return to a prior well-defined state (e.g. a default
 * "idle" state). In these scenarios terminal states are an indicator of a
 * programming error and are therefore checked for. This checks can however be
 * very expensive as the target states of all transitions must be checked. If
 * terminal states are actually needed, the check strictness can be reduced by
 * calling {@link #setAllowTerminalStates(boolean)
 * setAllowTerminalStates(true)}. This will still perform the check but only
 * produce warnings for terminal states and not an exception. If the performance
 * requirements require it the terminal state check can be disabled completely
 * by calling {@link #setCheckForTerminalStates(boolean)
 * setCheckForTerminalStates(false)}. It is recommended to keep the terminal
 * state check enabled whenever possible but at least for testing. If all
 * "legal" terminal states are known the check still allows for easy detection
 * of unwanted terminal states.
